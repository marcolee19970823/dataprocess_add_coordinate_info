# Python: Data process for adding geometry information into link.csv
Add coordinate field data into link.csv and the data is provided by node.csv. Utilize Python csv and pandas module to implement such functionality. 

## Folder: Version 1
You can enter the folder "Version 1" for more information. Actually, although the source of version 1 can correctly and completely realize the functionality, it still do not fully utilize the pandas module. I implement the functionality through a quite awkward way. Consequently, it needs to be improved.

I asked how to implement this data process in StackOverFlow website and got one excel-based solution, which can be founded in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68700725/how-to-add-the-coordinate-field-data-into-the-link-csv-according-to-the-node-csv 

## Folder: Version 2
Utilize apply() and lambda expression to fulfull geometry field for link.csv.
